# STEPS TO RUN OUR PROJECT
          - Install the software mentioned above and tc2011 our api folder which contains all medical datasets stored in Excel sheets.
	   (As the tc2011 api folder size excceeds the storage limit,cannot be uploaded)
	   -Using SQL script  navigate the SQL databasee.The task List performed are Export and Import from MySQL-Front,
	   .jsp(Java Servlet Page) files which is uploade here run using Apache Tomcat Server 6.0 and 7.0 installed before where version 6.0 service runner and 7.0 service runner both monitoring and service application aare instlled 
	   - the API specification for the Java Text Categorization Tools, 2011 release. This API is packed in tc2011api.jar, tc2011dist.jar, and tc2011lite.tgz. There are eleven Java packages:
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Api
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Db
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.FilterApi
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Jdi
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Lib
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.LoadDb
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.MedLine
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Sti
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Stri
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Tools
gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Util
The packages of gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.Api and gov.nih.nlm.nls.tc.FilterApi are the most useful packages for Text Categorization Tools users and should be paid more attention to. The other ten packages are used as supporting packages for Text Categorization Tools to work. End users may skip these nine packages.
	  - The safest way to manually install the service is to use the provided service.bat script. Administrator privileges are required to run this script. If necessary, you can use the /user switch to specify a user to use for the installation of the service.
	  - Opening Web Browser use Google Chrome for convinience)
	  -Start the Tomcat server.
          - Start your browser if it is not already running.
          - In the address area of the browser, type http://localhost:9999/bridging and submit that address to the browser.
          -The output of your JSP page will be displayed as our project starts run by starting service runner
